The kind of decisions, interventions, or actions that analysis results could support (e.g., management actions, advocacy for policy changes, etc.)

### Hurricane Island aquaculture and Scallop growth:

Hurricane Island is 10 miles southeast of Rockland and two miles southwest of Vinalhaven in the Fox Islands archipelago, Penobscot Bay, Maine. It has an interesting history, beginning first as a granite quarrying boomtown, an offshore outward-bound base and lastly as a center for science, leadership and marine research.
The Mission of Hurricane Island is to integrate science education, applied research, and leadership development through year-round educational programs and a seasonal, environmentally-sustainable island community. There program is aimed towards developing both the Center for Science and Leadership and Field Research Station
The Center for Science and Leadership (HICSL) is a scientific and education community on Hurricane Island that provides experiential, hands-on education programs and research opportunities focusing on marine sciences like Scallop growth, the one we are doing research on.

Our research mainly focuses on the following questions and analyzing:

*	The impact of the temperature of water on the growth rate of scallops.
*	The impact of density and gear type on the scallop’s growth through their lifetime in cages.
*	The impact of the location in which the scallops are kept.
*	The effect of small-scale closures on the scallop population
*	What is the population dynamic and recruitment to the specific area based on Spat data.
*	Which are is the best for settlement with given closure areas
*	The most effective way to increase the awareness regarding sustaining aquaculture.
*	What is the impact of density on growth rate.
*	How the scallops are to be measured.
*	What type of environment must be used to raise baby scallops.

We have around five excel sheets of dataset: 

1)	2018 Spat data
2)	MR&OP Scallop Spat Bags
3)	ScallopGrowth_2016-17_TaggedCage
4)	Temperature2_2016_TaggedCage and
5)	Temperature2_2017_TaggedCage

Also, there are various things I gathered from my research and the available datasets I have. And tried to analyze the areas where the scallops are present and how the scallops are cultivated in those area. There are many factors that affect scallop growth like temperature, location, closure zone, density and so on by these factors we will be analyzing how the scallop growth happen in certain area, which is best location for their growth, how the temperature affect the growth, which area the scallop are dying the most, what is the suitable latitude and longitude of certain area, what should be the suitable water temperature and many more.
There are three important dataset we got from the client with the help of which we are doing the analysis of scallop growth. The dataset we have are Spat bag, Scallop growth and Temperature data.
The details of these basic dataset are as follows:
*	Spat bags Data: Spat is basically the small baby scallop which is recruit to an area. This is a planktonic stage for scallop which helps us understand what population dynamics are in an area, it also gives us an idea of recruitments to that area. Spat data are from north of the closures, south of the closures and within the closure.  The data are from the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.
Based on data present with us the average height of cage 1 scallop in oct 2017 was 24.87 and cage 2 was 43.7333. This was Random Sampled Measurements of 20 Individual scallops taken randomly. Also, the annual average growth(mm) of the scallops for the years 2016-2017 is approximately 20.86, with this data we can check for further variation over the following years. 
This data will help us understand which area is good for settlement around the closed area. Spat data is also gathered from ocean point area which is another closed area, but a larger closed area for long term which has been managed by Department of Rain fishery.
*	Scallop growth data: Scallop growth data is about growing scallops which are involved in aquaculture research. This data set is used to understand the impact of different gear types on the growth rate of scallops. Scallops has been put in different type of gear and cages and the size of scallops are measured every year, month and some time by weekly. By doing this measurement we can understand the impact of density and gear type on scallop growth.
All the scallops are tagged, to differentiate them from one another which also helps to follow their growth as an individual throughout their lifetime in the cages where scallops are grown. The decisions can be taken based on the growth rate analysis.
*	Temperature Data: Temperature data are some from spat bags which were deployed, and some are from gear and cages which is deployed in Hurricane Island. The variables present in temperature data help us understand spat, population dynamic, popular influences on growth rate of scallops. Also, the temperature of water can be obtained from the temperature data.
I have done some research on methods used for scallop’s growth. I also gone through some research articles where I gathered some idea regarding scallop growth and methods used.

There are few traditional methods that need further analysis in order to better understand the growth rates of scallops.
Ear-hanging is one method that can be used to grow scallops. The technique comes from   Japanese scallop farms, where operations are large scale and far more mechanized. This method is used when scallops are about 2 inches. Under this method a hole is drilled in the “ear” or wing of the shell and gets threaded onto a rope that will be suspended in the water column. Ear hanging method is labor intensive process. There are some improved growth rates are analyzed by this method because of water flow and space. There are few other methods like bottom cage also has been used for growth analysis. Ear-hanging is an exciting possibility for Maine waters.

Other research article was a blog post by Research Assistant Jessie Batchelder:

This thesis mainly focused on specifically on Placopecten magellanicus “sea scallop” larval 
dynamics inside and outside the Lower Muscle Ridge closure area. The data they used for analysis came directly from the spat bags they deploy in the Muscle Ridge area as a metric to gauge larval abundance.
As part of the work is to understand current patterns in the Muscle Ridge Channel to determine likely directions of larval transport they also interviewed scallop and lobster fishers from the Midcoast area about their perceptions of prevailing current patterns. Talking to the fishers and hearing their perspectives added a separate aspect to their project.
